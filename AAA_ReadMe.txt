This distribution contains Python 3.1 routines for performing Gaussian 
Separation on a magnetic field (all three components) in a 2D, 
Cartesian surface.


IMPORTANT: Some of these routines call the "gauss_sep" module, but we 
have only supplied a "gauss_sep_YYMMDD" file. This Python code *MUST* 
be renamed, by removing "_YYMMDD" suffix, for the routines to run 
without error.


Users are strongly encouraged to read the documentation provided in 
the GaussDecompManual_YYMMDD.pdf manual.
